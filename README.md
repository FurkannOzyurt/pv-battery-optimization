# PV-Battery Optimization

This repository contains an optimization model designed to maximize the financial returns of photovoltaic (PV) solar systems integrated with battery storage in the Turkish electricity market.  

The model evaluates multiple scenarios to demonstrate how battery storage can enhance flexibility by shifting energy sales from low-price to high-price hours while respecting technical and operational constraints.

## üéØ Objective
- Maximize the financial return of a portfolio consisting of PV generation and/or battery storage.  
- Ensure operation complies with technical limitations such as state-of-charge (SOC), charging/discharging limits, and efficiency factors.  

---

## üìä Scenarios
1. **PV-only scenario**  
   Electricity produced by the PV system is directly sold to the market without storage.  

2. **Battery-only scenario**  
   The battery charges from the grid during low-price hours and discharges during high-price hours.  

3. **PV + Battery scenario**  
   Electricity generated by the PV system can either be sold directly or stored in the battery, which is later discharged when prices are higher.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Incorporates PV generation forecasts.  
- Models day-ahead electricity price signals in Turkey.  
- Includes battery technical constraints (SOC, charge/discharge efficiency, max capacity).  
- Provides comparative analysis across different operational scenarios.
